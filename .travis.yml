# How the magic numbers work and where to put them:
#
# The AWS CLI that you get from pip is the tool likeliest to be up to date
# with the API. It uses some environment variables described in its docs:
# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html
#
# We set them by going to the Travis UI at
# https://travis-ci.org/rust-lang/rust-www/settings and creating the variables
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY with the appropriate values. 
#
# The values in those env vars come from the Travis account's IAM credentials,
# which you can get from
# https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-1#users if you're
# logged in as someone with the appropriate permissions. The
# cloudfront distribution-id is listed in the ID field of the distribution for
# www-rust-lang-org on the console at
# https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home?region=us-west-1. 
#
# For the deploy step, the secret access key is encrypted on the command line. 
# Encryption uses the Travis CLI, so on your laptop, 
# 
#   $ gem install travis
#
# The string you encrypt for the SECRET_ACCESS_KEY will be the same as the
# string in the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY variable that you set earlier.
# To encrypt the single variable: 
#
#   $ travis encrypt -r rust-lang/rust-www "abc123"
#
# The output of that command will contain a `secure: "7890wxyzPQR"` line which
# you then add to `.travis.yml` under `secret_access_key`.
