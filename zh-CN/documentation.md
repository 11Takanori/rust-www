# Rust 语言文档

If you haven't seen Rust at all yet, the first thing you should read
is the introduction to the book, [Rust 程序设计语言][book]。It will give you a good idea of what Rust is like,
show you how to install it, and explain its syntax and concepts. Upon
completing the book, you'll be an intermediate Rust developer, and
will have a good grasp of the fundamental ideas behind Rust.

## 学习 Rust

[Rust 程序设计语言][book]. Also known as "The Book",
The Rust Programming Language is the most comprehensive resource for
