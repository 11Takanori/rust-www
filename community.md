# Rust Community

We have a great community and we want to keep it that way. Rust is
more than just a revolutionary programming language, it is a
tight-knit community with a [legendary dedication to kindness and
inclusivity][techwhirl]. We are committed to providing a friendly,
safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual
orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal
characteristic. Our [code of conduct][coc] must be observed in
all matters relating to Rust online.

## How to Get Help

[IRC Channels][rust_irc]

Rustaceans primarily communicate via IRC. The
[#rust][rust_irc] channel on Moznet is a venue for general
discussion about Rust, and a good place to ask for help.  You'll find
people willing to help you with any questions you may have, and
responses are typically very fast. To get involved in the development
of Rust itself, for anything about contribution, or to find a mentor,
[#rust-internals][internals_irc] is the right channel. There are also
some more specific IRC channels noted below.

## User Groups

[Rust User Groups][user_group]

There are more than 50 Rust User Groups worldwide in over 20 countries
with over 7,000 members. Rustaceans meet periodically in Rust User
Groups.  Its a great introduction to the community and a great way to
learn and socialize with other people with a similar interest.
Meetings are usually monthly and very informal. Meetings are open to
everyone.

## People

[Rust Teams][teams]

Rust has a community-driven development process where most decisions
are made through consensus, under the stewardship of a core team. The
[Core Team][core_team] is responsible for steering the design and
development process, overseeing the introduction of new features, and
ultimately making decisions for which there is no consensus (this
happens rarely). The [Language Design Team][language_team] is
responsible for design of new language features. The [Library
Team][library_team] is responsible for the Rust standard library,
rust-lang crates, and conventions. The [Compiler Team][compiler_team]
is responsible for compiler internals and optimizations. The [Tooling
and Infrastructure Team][tool_team] is responsible for support for
Cargo, Multirust, and CI Infrastructure. The [Community
Team][community_team] is responsible for coordinating events,
outreach, commercial users, teaching materials, and exposure. The
[Moderation Team][mod_team] is responsible for helping to uphold the
[code of conduct][coc].

## Rust Development

[How to contribute][contribute]

According to [CodeTriage][codetriage], the Rust
language has the most contributors of any programming language. If you
want to join in the fun but aren't sure what to work on, please take
a look at [how to contribute][contribute].

[Rust Internals Forum][internals]

This is the main forum for discussing the design and implementation of
Rust.

[Github][github]

This is where all the source code resides.

[RFCs][rfcs]

The RFC (request for comments) process is the main pathway through
which the Rust community and the core team reach consensus on new
features entering the language and standard libraries.
