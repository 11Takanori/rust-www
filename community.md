# Rust Community

We have a great community and we want to keep it that way. Rust is
more than just a revolutionary programming language, it is a
tight-knit community with a [legendary dedication to kindness and
inclusivity][internals]. We are committed to
providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity,
religion, or similar personal characteristic. Our [code of
conduct][coc] must be observed in
all matters relating to Rust online.

## User Groups

[Rust User Groups][user_group]

There are more than 50 Rust User Groups worldwide in over 20 countries
with over 7,000 members. Rustaceans meet periodically in Rust User
Groups.  Its a great introduction to the community and a great way to
learn and socialize with other people with a similar interest.
Meetings are usually monthly and very informal. Meetings are open to
everyone.

## People

[Rust Teams][teams]

Rust has a community-driven development process where most decisions
are made through consensus, under the stewardship of a core team. The
[Core Team][core_team] is responsible for steering the design and
development process, overseeing the introduction of new features, and
ultimately making decisions for which there is no consensus (this
happens rarely). The [Language Design Team][language_design_team] is
responsible for design of new language features. The [Library
Team][library_team] is responsible for the Rust standard library,
rust-lang crates, and conventions. The [Compiler Team][compiler_team]
is responsible for compiler internals and optimizations. The [Tooling
and Infrastructure Team][tool_team] is responsible for support for
Cargo, Multirust, and CI Infrastructure. The [Community
Team][community_team] is responsible for coordinating events,
outreach, commercial users, teaching materials, and exposure. The
[Moderation Team][mod_team] is responsible for helping to upholding
the [code of conduct][coc].

## Rust Development

[How to contribute][contribute]

According to [CodeTriage][codetriage], the Rust
language has the most contributors of any programming language. If you
want to join in the fun but aren't sure what to work on, please take
a look at [how to contribute][contribute].

[Github][github]

This is where all the source code resides.

[RFCs][rfcs]

The RFC (request for comments) process is the main pathway through
which the Rust community and the core team reach consensus on new
features entering the language and standard libraries.
