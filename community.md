# Rust Community

We have a great community and we want to keep it that way. Rust is
more than just a revolutionary programming language, it is a
tight-knit community with a [legendary dedication to kindness and
inclusivity](https://internals.rust-lang.org/). We are committed to
providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity,
religion, or similar personal characteristic. Our [code of
conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html) must be observed in
all matters relating to the official Rust website.

In the Rust community most real-time collaboration happens through
IRC. The
[#rust](https://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust)
channel is a venue for general discussion about Rust, and a good place
to ask for help. You'll find people willing to help you with any
questions you may have, and responses are typically very fast.

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust)

Stack Overflow is a question and answer site for programmers.
Searching for your problem might reveal someone who has asked it
before.

[Rust Forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/)

Rust Programming Language Forum is for general discussion and broader questions.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/rustlang)

[Rust Moderation Team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html#Moderation)

## User Groups, Conferences and Workshops

[Rust User Groups](./user_groups.html)

There are more than 50 Rust User Groups worldwide in over 20 countries
with over 7,000 members. Rustaceans meet periodically in Rust User
Groups.  Its a great introduction to the community and a great way to
learn and socialize with other people with a similar interest.
Meetings are usually monthly and very informal. Meetings are open to
everyone.

## People

[Rust Teams](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html)

Rust has a community-driven development process where most decisions
are made through consensus, under the stewardship of a [Core
team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html#Core)'.

[Github](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)

This is where all the source code resides.

[RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs)

The RFC (request for comments) process is the main pathway through
which the Rust community and the core team reach consensus on new
features entering the language and standard libraries.
