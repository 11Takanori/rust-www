### Rust Development

[How to contribute](https://github.com/efindlay/Rust_community_page/blob/master/contribute.md)

[Github](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)

[RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs)

Substantial changes to Rust are put through a bit of a design process
and produce a consensus among the Rust community and the core team.
The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a
consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the language
and standard libraries, so that all stakeholders can be confident
about the direction the language is evolving in.
