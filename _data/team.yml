# The list of teams and peoples is shared among different languages,
# but the team names and their descriptions can be localized.
# Copy the following to each language's `team.md` and uncomment it to start translating:
#
# localized-teams:
#   Core team:
#     name: "A localized name of the Core team"
#     responsibility: "A localized text for the responsibility of the Core team"
#   # and so on, see below for the full list
#
# localized-ex-teams:
#   core: "A localized *short* name of the Core team"
#   lang: "Same for the Language design team"
#   libs: "Same for the Library team"
#
# Any untranslated text (either missing or invalidated via updates) will remain in English.
# Please note that link anchors always use English names, like `#Core-team`.

# map from GH username to name & irc nick (irc nick can be omitted if it
# matches GH).
